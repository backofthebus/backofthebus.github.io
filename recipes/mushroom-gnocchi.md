# Mushroom Gnocchi

### Ingredients
* 1 package gnocchi
* About 3oz oyster mushrooms
* 2 clove garlic
* 1 shallot
* Dry White Wine
* Parmesan cheese
* Red pepper
* Salt
* Black pepper
* Basil (ideally fresh)
* Butter
* Olive oil
* Optional spinach/arugula for wilting

### Prep
* Mushrooms: separate the head form the stems, keep the heads intact. Stems and small mushroom bits should be minced thin, place in separate bowls
* Mince garlic, add to bowl with small mushroom bits
* Thinly slice shallot

### Cook
Boil salted water for gnocchi. Time this so the gnocchi is finishing around when your sauce is nearly ready.

Heat pan, add oil. Add large mushrooms, salt, pepper and cook until beginning to brown- this will be a little while.

Add shallots, cook until becoming soft. Add a pad of butter and stir in.

Add garlic and small mushroom bits now, along with a little more butter and salt.

When garlic is golden and mushroom bits are cooked through, deglaze with white wine, add another pad of butter, and grate in parmesan. Add red pepper flakes to desired spicy level.

You should now have a thicc aromatic af sauce, and gnocchi should be almost ready. Use slotted spoon to transfer gnocchi into pan, and then add some gnocchi water to pan to form sauce.

Add basil, optionally add spinach or arugula and wilt greens (mostly for color). Stir it all together and simmer on very low until it thickens up.

Serve with more grated cheese and a bit of black pepper.

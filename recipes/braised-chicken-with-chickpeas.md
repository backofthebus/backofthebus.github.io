# Braised Chicken with Chickpeas and Kale

### Ingredients
* 2 boneless skinless chicken thighs, marinated in:
	* Big Pinch of Maras or Aleppo Pepper Flakes
	* Big Pinch of Kosher Salt
	* Big Pinch Za'atar
	* 1/4 cup Olive Oil
	* A generous drizzle of Turkish Pomegranate Sauce (nar eksisi sos)
* 1 can chickpeas, drained
* Half a Bunch of Kale, torn into bite sized pieces
* Half a Red Onion, sliced like half moons
* 2 Cloves Garlic, crushed
* 1/2 cup of Vegetable Stock
* Splash of Red Wine Vinegar


#### Ingredient Notes 
Maras and Aleppo Pepper are tasty, somewhat fruity hot red pepper varieties. They have medium, building, lingering heat. You can substitute standard red pepper flakes, but these are really worth seeking out.

Turkish Pomegranate Sauce (nar eksisi sos) is a surprisingly tart (almost astringent), slightly sweet pomegranate concentrate that will be the main acid in this dish. If you cant find this, you could probably reduce some pomegranate juice with some lemon juice and perhaps some honey.

Both of these can likely be found at a Turkish or other Middle Eastern market!

#### Equipment
Dutch Oven or other large heavy bottomed pot
Ideally an instant read thermometer

### Prep
Marinate the chicken a few hours ahead of time. Combine ingredients in a bowl, and toss the bowl into the fridge until you're ready to cook.

### Cook
Heat your Dutch Oven over medium and add oil. When oil is hot, add red onions and break up with a wooden spoon. Salt slightly. Cook until somewhat soft.

Add chicken, and all it's marinade, and brown each side for a minute or two.

Add can of chickpeas and the crushed garlic, and stir to combine. 

Season with a big pinch each of Za'atar and Maras pepper, as well as the stock and red wine vinegar. Use more or less pepper depending on your spice tolerance.

Stir everything together and bring to a simmer.

After about 5 minutes, add shredded kale, and slowly stir occasionally to combine

Simmer, stirring occasionally, until chicken is cooked through (165 degrees Fahrenheit) and liquid has reduced to a nice sauce. Serve with a cold cucumber/tomato/parsley salad.
